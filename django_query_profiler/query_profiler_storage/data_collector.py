"""
This is the module that collects & stores data (in its data structures, maintained in a thread-local) when a query is
executed.

There are three main functions in this module:
1. enter_profiled_mode : Called from the context manager
2. exit_profiled_mode: Called from the context manager
3. add_query_profiler_data: Called from the Django hook, when any query is executed

Complexity in this module comes from the fact that context manager can be nested.  If we call one context manager after
another, we don't have any of the complexity about bookkeeping about which index we entered, which we exited etc.

Nested context manager results in following complexity:
1.  Every time we exit, we expect only that data to be returned which had happened since the start of the same block.
    That means we would have to segregate the data when storing, and aggregate data when returning for each nested
    invocation so that we can know when exiting the block of which data belong to this exit.
2.  We are supporting two types of QueryProfilerLevel - one of type Query, and one of QuerySignature.   Nesting makes it
    challenging since now, we have to deal with the case of what type of profiler we should run in each block.

    We also have to deal with issue of various combinations of {Query, QuerySignature} nesting.  Even though the user
    asks for a given queryProfilerLevel, we would have to decide based on nesting, which queryProfilerLevel would be
    active

Implementation Notes:
--------------------
1.  To segregate the data for each time we enter via the context manager, we are going to use a List.  Data at an
    index represents the query profiled data that was collected when that "index" was active.  Lets say we are at 4th
    nested context manager => we would be writing data at list[3]
2.  When we exit from a context manger, we are going to return all the data that we had started collecting, from the
    index at which we entered.  ie. Lets assume we enter at index 2, and now list has grown to index 5.  When we exit
    from index 2, we would want to get all data from index 2 to 5.
    Its very clear from above that we would need to keep track of index when we had entered.  For that, we are going
    to use a stack of indices A stack would work because when we exit a block, we would pop from the stack
3.  "QueryProfilerData" is the container that collects all the data that we collect.   When we enter a block, we
    initialize with an empty container.  Any time Django hook calls to register a query, we add existing data to the
    new data, create "QueryProfiledData" object which has combined data, and use this new object in the list
4.  For finding which QueryProfilerType would be active, we are again using a stack.  And using the fact that if anyone
    above the current call has used QUERY_SIGNATURE, the active one would be QUERY_SIGNATURE
